mailer.py
=========

* Script to send a common mail with/without attachments to 1 or more recipients. For usage, look at `send_mails.sh`
* The script prompts the user to enter the sender's gmail address and password.
* The sender email must allow less secure apps to access the account. Refer the link on how to do this: https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255?hl=en.
* To avoid any security threat to your account, make sure you turn the less secure app on only while using this script and turn off once done.
